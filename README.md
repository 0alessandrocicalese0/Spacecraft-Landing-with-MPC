# Spacecraft Landing with MPC

This project pioneers the application of advanced model predictive control (MPC) techniques to enhance the precision and reliability of spacecraft landings. Utilizing MATLAB and Simulink, the initiative integrates sophisticated algorithms to maneuver spacecraft during the critical phases of powered descent and landing. In the *MATLAB* scripts **Code.m** we calculate the trajectories using **Model Predictive Control** saved in **Rocket.mat** and in **Simulation_3D.m** we simulates a 3D descent dynamic.

Central to the project is the development and implementation of a linear MPC framework, outlined in the Paper.pdf, which discusses the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of thrust vectoring control for spacecraft. After some semplification the model used is expressed in the file **model.md**.
